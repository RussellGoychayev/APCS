array
  sequence of values

elements
  values in an array

new operator creates new objects

values of array have to be of same type, for example:
  int[]
  double[]

<value type>[] <array name> = {
<values>
};

or

int[] a;
a = new int[5];

indexes/indices

arrays are mutable

display and manipulate arrays by iterating over elements

aliases

traversal and search

(non)deterministic and PRNGs

enhanced for loops

for (int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
    int value = values[i];
    System.out.println(value);
}

can be rewritten (through enhanced for loops) as

for (int value : values) {
    System.out.println(value);
}

Enhanced for loops often make the code more readable,
 especially for accumulating values. But they
 are not helpful when you need to refer to the
 index, as in search operations.
