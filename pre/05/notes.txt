anatomy of a method:

public static RETURNTYPE NAME(ARGUMENTS){
 BODY
}

incremental development
be smart with it

scaffolding

method composition

overloading:
two methods share one name; java differentiates
them by their parameters

Boolean methods

Javadoc tags (/** */):
@param
@return

leap of faith (for recursion)
(work around flow of execution)

unreachable statements are seen as errors
even though sometimes they dont matter
